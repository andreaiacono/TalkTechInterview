 *  A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time.
 *  Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.
 *
 *  Example:
 *  if the stairs have 4 steps, the solution is 7 ways:
 *  1) 1-1-1-1
 *  2) 1-1-2
 *  3) 1-2-1
 *  4) 1-3
 *  5) 2-2
 *  6) 2-1-1
 *  7) 3-1
